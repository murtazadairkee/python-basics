Easy to learn and write\n","2. Versatile\n","3. Strong community support\n","\n","Q2 - What is an interpreter in Python\n","\n","An interpreter reads and executes Python code line-by-line, converting it into machine code.\n","\n","Q3 - What are pre-defined keywords in Python\n","\n","Pre defined keywords are reserved words that have special meaning in Python. Example if, else, while, etc\n","\n","Q4 - Can keywords be used as variable names\n","\n","No, keywords cannot be used as variable names because they have predefined meanings in the language.\n","\n","Q5 - What is mutability in Python\n","\n","Mutability means whether an object content can be changed after it is created.\n","\n","Q6 - Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable\n","\n","Lists are designed to be dynamic and changeable, useful for situations where data updates.\n","Tuples are fixed and secure, ideal for constant data or keys in dictionaries.\n","\n","Q7 - What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python\n","\n","== checks value equality and is checks identity\n","\n","Q8 - What are logical operators in Python\n","\n","Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements:\n","\n","1. and - True if both conditions are true\n","2. or - True if at least one condition is true\n","\n","Q9 - What is type casting in Python\n","\n","Type casting means converting a value from one data type to another.\n","\n","Q10 - What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n","\n","Implicit - Done by python itself\n","Explicit - Manually by the programmer\n","\n","Q11 - What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python\n","\n","Conditional statements allow the program to make decisions and execute code based on conditions\n","\n","Q12 - How does the elif statement work?\n","\n","elif stands for “else if”. It checks another condition if the previous if was false.\n","\n","Q13 - What is the difference between for and while loops?\n","\n","1. for loop: used when you know in advance how many times to loop (e.g., for items in a list)\n","2. while loop: used when you loop until a condition becomes false (condition-based)\n","\n","Q14 - Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop\n","\n","When you don’t know beforehand how many times the loop will run.\n","1. Example: Keep asking for a password until the correct one is entered.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"O7CpzslpOgx_"}}]}
